## About Me

I’m a first year PhD student supervised by Prof. <a href="https://vlislab22.github.io/vlislab/linwang.html">Lin Wang</a> at VLISLab, HKUST (GZ), interested in various DL/CV topics from low-level to high-level vision.

Prior to HKUST, I obtained my B.ENG and M.ENG in Information and Communication Engineering from Northeastern University (NEU), where I focused on medical image analysis.

Lately, I’ve been focusing on Multi-modal Learning.
